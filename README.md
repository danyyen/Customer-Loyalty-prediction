Our client, a grocery retailer, hired a market research consultancy to append market level customer loyalty information to the database.  However, only around 50% of the client's customer base could be tagged, thus the other half did not have this information present.  Let's use ML to solve this!

# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Context <a name="overview-context"></a>

Our client, a grocery retailer, hired a market research consultancy to append market level customer loyalty information to the database.  However, only around 50% of the client's customer base could be tagged, thus the other half did not have this information present.

The overall aim of this work is to accurately predict the *loyalty score* for those customers who could not be tagged, enabling our client a clear understanding of true customer loyalty, regardless of total spend volume - and allowing for more accurate and relevant customer tracking, targeting, and comms.

To achieve this, we looked to build out a predictive model that will find relationships between customer metrics and *loyalty score* for those customers who were tagged, and use this to predict the loyalty score metric for those who were not.
